My own implimentation of a Mootools modial dialog box for asp.net pages.
Replaces the asp.net javascript postback href with 'javascript:void(0)'
and does a postback with the result from the dialog box.

I scripted this to be able to use a confirm dialog box when deleting rows on an asp.net GridView.
